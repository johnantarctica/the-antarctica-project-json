Come on. Do we need a “reminder”? It’s ridiculous.\n**03**: its more of like a symbolic thing i think? to build up anticipation \n**01**: I must admit I don’t understand the issue. That was an accurate description of time, yes? Regardless of our timezones, given the general level of precision.\n**02**: This is a private comm channel for internal documentation and notification \n**02**: When it lights up before the project has started i expect something like “the antarctica project has been cancelled” or “i just got fucking murdered” or whatever\n**02**: Not that time is passing normally\n**03**: this is unfair you type so fast haha\n**02**: And no @03 we do not need symbolic buildup this isn’t a promotional release it’s. Well\n**03**: computer whiz\n**02**: I guess\n**01**: Perception is reality, %nameencrypt%.\n**02**: I\n**02**: Shut the fuck up\n**02**: I guess I’m not convinced of the security of this thing it’s stupid for us to even be talking\n**01**: I am not using this to talk.\n**03**: it’ll be fine 01 always wipes the logs at the end of the day nobody is going to see this\n**02**: I suppose.\n**03**: he just feels confident with this kind of structure\n**03**: its a neurodivergent thing you know how he gets \n**01**: Please do not attempt to psychoanalyze me in here.\n**03**: im sorry\n**01**: Now it’s been completely buried under irrelevant chatter.\n**01**: Still around three days until The Antarctica Project.

      "content": "Hello! I hope this message finds you well. Can’t help but notice that you rarely actually respond to me, but I understand that to be a result of your disposition and the lack of urgent necessity to reply to me if nothing is wrong.\n\nIt is two days until the beginning of The Antarctica Project by my count. I hope we’re at least synchronized on that point. Hope everything is going smoothly, etc etc. The real reason I’m reaching out is because there’s something you ought to know about the project. Specifically regarding the amount of participants. It’s probably not wise to go into specifics here, but this is something you ought to know and this is a place I know you check.\n\nThat’s all. Just reach out to me and I’ll let you know what’s going on. Toodleoo, farewell, see you soon.",
